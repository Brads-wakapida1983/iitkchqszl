I just walked out of the theater after watching Kesari Chapter 2: The Untold Story of Jallianwala Bagh, and honestly, my head’s still spinning. I’m tired, man. It’s like I just spent hours running in circles, emotions flinging around like clothes in a chaotic laundry cycle. You know those films where you walk out slightly dazed, not really sure if you forgot your popcorn or your brain somewhere in the last scene? Yeah, that.

> I mean, the film had its moments, right? Flashy colors and intense drumbeats - by God, they went all out, like the cinematographer drank sixteen espressos before filming. But then, there were moments where I just wanted to shout, “Calm down, not every frame needs to punch me in the face!” Sarcastically, because that’s just how I’m built, I think about downloading the movie to slow it all down. Watch a single second frame by frame.

Mixing historical facts with a dollop of fiction, some parts really got under my skin. Jallianwala Bagh—a name echoing like an old guilty conscience. Surreal portrayals reminded me of those dreams where things are overwhelming and you’re standing in your underwear, you know? That layer of realism interlaced with drama seemed to flicker like a broken bulb that you know you should fix but you’re too lazy to get the ladder.

Oh, and there's this scene. Wow. I swear, tears slipped down before my sarcastic self could stop them. It's got that heart-pounding chaos, like running a marathon on a treadmill that's set to fast-forward. The emotional hurricane—not entirely unwelcome but exhausting. And boy, being in the audience felt like dodging a thousand emotional punches.

  console.log(Emotion level:  + level);
  if (level > 5) {
    console.log(Tears);
  } else {
    console.log(Dry Eyes);
  }
}

But really, the true hero of the film was that chai-wala outside the theater with inexplicably heavenly samosas. And now I’m back on earth, munching like a starved critter. Life hack post-movie: savor every bite and let the flavor ground you after jumping through emotional hoops. Just note for next time, a gym bag with extra patience needed. Or maybe just watch an animated comedy next.
